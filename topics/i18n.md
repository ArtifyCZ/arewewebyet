title: "Internationalisation"

level: 5

intro: Internationalisation is still very immature and unstable, with most libraries being only weeks old and not used in production yet. Furthermore, other than the usual gettext approach, the Rust ecosystem doesn't offer much yet. ICU is completely non-existent.


packages:
 - fluent-locale
 - fluent-rs
 - gettext
 - gettext-rs
 - intl_pluralrules
 - libphonenumber-sys
 - unic

missing:
 - ICU
 - a proper [ECMA 402 Intl Implementation](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/858)
